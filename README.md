# Long-read Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline (ONT + PIPseq)

This pipeline was used to analyze single-cell data generated by an adapted PIPseq protocol for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. Please note that this Github utilizes count matrices that have first undergone our Single-Cell Nextflow Pipeline (https://github.com/UK-SBCoA-EbbertLab/single_cell_nextflow_pipeline).

## Analysis Overview
This analysis pipeline consists of 9 steps, including one  which consist of tuning parameters for analyses.

### Step 0 -- Initial Filtering

## Step 1 -- Count Matrix Preparation

## Step 2 -- Quality Control Filtering

## Step 3 -- AutoZI Parameter Tuning

## Step 4 -- AutoZI Modeling

## Step 5 -- Cell-Type Assignment

## Step 6 -- Sub-Cell Type Assignment

## Step 7 -- Bulk Figure Generation

## Step 8 -- Paper Figure Generation

## Step 9 -- Unique / Raw Count Analyses
