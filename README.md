# Long-read Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline (ONT + PIPseq)

This pipeline was used to analyze single-cell data generated by an adapted PIPseq protocol for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. Please note that this Github utilizes count matrices that have first undergone our Single-Cell Nextflow Pipeline, which can be found in the following GitHub repository: (https://github.com/UK-SBCoA-EbbertLab/single_cell_nextflow_pipeline).

## Analysis Overview
This analysis pipeline consists of 9 steps, including one which consists of tuning parameters for analyses. These analyses were performed in a singularity container, as detailed in our paper, which can be retrieved as seen in the singularity_container directory.

### Step 0 -- Initial Filtering
This step reduces file-size for more efficient downstream performance by removing genes and isoforms expressed in very few cells, and cells likely representing empty droplets, potentially with ambient RNA. The resulting filtered matrices are then rounded to two decimal places to further minimize file size and transposed for compatibility with downstream steps. 

This step is implimented in Java. For setup and usage details, refer to dedicated README.md in the Step 0 directory.

### Step 1 -- Count Matrix Preparation
This step annotates the expression matrices produced in Step 0 and prepares the structure for downsteam analyses. The GRCh38.113 GTF is parsed to add in the gene symbol according to ensembl ID, and a combined ID with gene symbol, ensembl gene ID, and ensembl transcript ID (Gene-level-- SYMBOL:ENSGID; Isoform-level--SYMBOL:ENSGID:ENSTID. In the case of novel genes, the absent symbol is omitted (BambuGene# or BambuGene#:BambuTx#). These annotated matrices are written to Parquet matrices and stored as an AnnData object (.h5ad) for efficient storage and loading.

### Step 2 -- Quality Control Filtering
This step loads the .h5ad matrices from Step 1 and computes per-cell, per-gene, and per-isoform quality control metrics. Cells are filtered based on the thresholds determined for total reads, % mitochondrial genes/isoforms, number of unique genes/isoforms, and % hemoglobin genes/isoforms per cell (see Table S2). Genes and isoforms with low expression in both replicates (<10 cells) were removed. Doublet detection and removal are performed using the Scrublet package and datasets were concatenated for downstream modeling. Optional summary statistics are also generated as shown in Table S7.

### Step 3 -- AutoZI Parameter Tuning

### Step 4 -- AutoZI Modeling

### Step 5 -- Cell-Type Assignment

### Step 6 -- Sub-Cell Type Assignment

### Step 7 -- Bulk Figure Generation

### Step 8 -- Paper Figure Generation

### Step 9 -- Unique / Raw Count Analyses
